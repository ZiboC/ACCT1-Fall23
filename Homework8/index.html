            <h2>Game Concept</h2>
            <p>I want to make an obstacle avoidance game that can interact with the human body. A computer camera is used to recognize a human face, then a movable ball is generated at the position of the nose, and the movement of the ball follows the position of the nose in the screen. Then, obstacles will fall randomly from the top of the canvas, and the player needs to move the ball to avoid the falling obstacles. The game ends when the ball hits an obstacle. During the game there is a timer to keep track of the time, and a difficulty system to adjust the number and speed of the falling balls.</p>

                <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
                <p>At the very beginning, variables are declared to store the state of the gameanvas and remove it from the balls array if it is.</p>

                <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
                <p>Set up the canvas, start the video capture, initialize poseNet with a callback for when it's ready, and hide the video element. Conclude by calling resetGame to start the game with initial settings.</p>
