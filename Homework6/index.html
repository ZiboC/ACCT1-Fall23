    <h1>Week 5 Complex Interactive System</h1>
    
    <h2>Creates a canvas and an empty array called "balls". </h2>

    <h3>Clear the canvas with background(220) before each frame to update the ball positions. Use nested for loops to check for collisions and merging of balls. The outer loop iterates through all the balls, while the inner loop iterates through balls that come before the current ball. If two balls intersect , they merge into a new ball. Check if a ball is outside the canvas and remove it from the balls array if it is.</h3>

    <h4>When the mouse is clicked. It creates a new ball with random properties (position, size, speed, and color) at the mouse's current location and adds it to the balls array.</h4>

    <h5>Defines how individual balls behave and interact in the simulation. The main part of the code uses instances of this class to create, move, and manage the behavior of multiple bouncing balls.</h5>

    <h6>Click the mouse at a random position on the canvas, each click will result in a randomly colored sphere, which will collide and combine with each other.</h6>
